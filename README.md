This is my landing page replica of [https://oxylabs.io/](https://oxylabs.io/), done in about 5 hours. You can view the live version [here](https://allmind-landing-page.vercel.app/)

The website is best viewed in a desktop browser of at least 1080px width, as I did not have time to implement responsiveness on smaller screens.

## How to run

1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```

3. Run the project

```bash
yarn dev
```

4. Open the project in your browser

```bash
http://localhost:3000
```

I implemented most of the design and some of the functional features. Here are some of the things that I didn't have time to implement:
- Button hover animations
- Footer
- Some icons and images
- Metadata (e.g. favicon)
- Some subpages (e.g. stewardship section)
- Some functional features (e.g. dropdowns)
- Responsiveness
- Polishing the font weights and sizes
